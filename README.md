## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Benn.

Yes, my name is spelt like that. 

As a student at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg) studying Computer Science, I like learning new things and tackling challenging problems. Beyond programming, I'm also helping to organise events at [NUS Hackers](https://nushackers.org) as a coreteam member.

Currently, I'm doing an internship at [QCP Capital](https://www.qcp.capital/). This coming summer, I'll be doing another internship at [Binance](https://binance.com) this coming summer.
