## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Benn.

Yes, my name is spelt like that. 

As a student at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg) studying Computer Science, I like learning new things and tackling challenging problems. 

I'm currently interning at [QCP Capital](https://www.qcp.capital/). This coming summer, I'll be interning at [Binance](https://binance.com) as a software engineer.
