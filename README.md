### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Benn.

Yes, my name is spelt like that!

As a student at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg) studying Computer Science, I like learning new things and tackling challenging problems. 

I've previously interned as a software engineer at [Apple](https://apple.com), [The Trade Desk](https://thetradedesk.com) and [Binance](https://binance.com).

Always happy to chat about topics adjacent to tech :-)
