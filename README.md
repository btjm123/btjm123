### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Benn.

Yes, my name is spelt like that!

As a Year 1 student at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg) studying Computer Science, I like learning new things and tackling challenging problems. 

This summer, I'll be interning at [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) as a software engineer.
